## Software Development
I went to Full Sail University to learn computer science through their certificate program. I studied C# and C++. I am fascinated with how technology plays a big role in protecting every aspect of humans lives.  Through Full Sail University I have been able to work on a few projects worth mentioning to get me started such as Game of Life Project and a simple banking application.
